Perfect question — because *this is the pivot point*.

Rainbow CRM has now crossed from “solid beta” into **production-ready architecture**: it’s secure, modular, and testable. What comes next is about **governance, insight, and monetization** — the Council, the metrics, and the coins.

Let’s map this cleanly so you can sequence it right.

---

## 🪞 Phase 11.2 → Council Dashboard (Admin + Oversight Layer)

**Goal:** Give you and trusted admins total visibility into what the system is doing — security, usage, jobs, revenue — all from one glassy Neon-pink interface.

### Core Components

1. **Metrics Overview**

   * Totals: active users, approvals this week, assets uploaded, coins spent.
   * Real-time events from `analytics_events` and `system_logs`.

2. **Security & Health**

   * Failed logins / 401s / 403s by endpoint.
   * Cron heartbeat monitor (supabase `health_ping` events).
   * Rate-limit trip counter (from `system_logs`).

3. **Operations Console**

   * View running jobs (mockups, reverse vision).
   * Approve/revoke API keys for team members.
   * Coin wallet inspector (from `mirror_wallets`).

4. **User Management**

   * Promote / demote roles (`empress_role`).
   * Soft-ban compromised accounts or IPs.
   * “Login as user” sandbox (for support).

5. **Design:**

   * Tabs: **Overview | Users | Jobs | Wallets | Security | Logs**.
   * Neon glass cards + live Recharts.
   * Role-restricted route `/dashboard/council` only for `empress_role='admin'`.

✅ **Deliverable:** One React admin page + two server endpoints (`/api/council/metrics` and `/api/council/users`) fed by Supabase views.

## 🪙 Phase 12.0 → Monetization Scaffold (Mirror Coins Shop)

Once the Council works and logs are clean, we drop the Mirror Coins economy back in.

### Key Features

* **Buy Mirror Coins Modal**

  * Uses Square sandbox (or Stripe) → updates `mirror_wallets` + `mirror_tx`.
* **Transaction Ledger**

  * Filters: all | mockups | reverse-vision | purchases.
* **Pricing Table**

  * API-driven cost per action; admins adjust pricing via Council.
* **Fail-safe Credit Guard**

  * Blocks job queue submission if insufficient balance.
* **Email receipts + push notifications** after purchases.

✅ **Deliverable:**

1. `/api/coins/purchase` route with Square sandbox.
2. `/api/coins/pricing` config table.
3. Front-end modal integrated into both Rainbow CRM & Baby Empress OS.

## 🧩 Phase 12.1 → Integration Unification

* Merge analytics between Baby Empress OS & Rainbow CRM (shared Supabase schema).
* Single sign-on (SSO) via JWT across both apps.
* Unified theme + Mirror Protocol tags visible in both UIs.

## 🧭 Suggested Sequence

1. **Phase 11.2 — Council Dashboard (Admin Oversight)**
2. **Phase 12.0 — Monetization Scaffold (Mirror Coins)**
3. **Phase 12.1 — Unified Analytics + SSO**
4. Optional: **Phase 12.2 — AI Support Agent “Echo”** (admin assistant that summarizes Council data daily)

Would you like me to generate the **Phase 11.2 Council Dashboard payload** next — code, schema, and React layout — so you can see your system metrics live inside the app?
