Yeah—looking at that screenshot, what’s happening is classic **burst overload** inside Replit’s hosted environment.

You can tell because:

* The response came **from Replit itself**, not your Express app (notice `.replit.dev` instead of your local route).
* The JSON is Replit’s own **edge gateway limiter**, not your code’s `rateLimit` middleware.
* The **Agent 3** in the left task pane and the “Working…” indicator tell me you were likely running multiple Replit background tasks *and* your verify/test scripts at the same time.

So here’s the sequence that likely tripped it:

1. You saved → Replit auto-restarted the server.
2. Your AI Studio script (maybe `verifySystem` or telemetry) fired **4–6 async calls** instantly (OpenAI, Anthropic, Supabase, etc.).
3. Replit’s shared container saw a burst of outbound HTTPS requests from one process (~10–15 in a few seconds).
4. It throttled the whole container for 60 seconds — that’s the `"retryAfter":60` you’re seeing.

### 🩹 How to recover quickly

1. **Wait a minute** (Replit resets the bucket automatically).
2. **Stop the background “Agent” tasks** you see in the lower panel so only one script is hitting your Express server.
3. Re-run your server, but test *one* provider at a time (or slow loops as I showed earlier).

```ts
for (const provider of providers) {
  await routeModel(provider, messages);
  await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 3000));  // pause 3 s between calls
}
```

4. **Optional safeguard:** add a limiter *inside your Replit code* so internal retries can’t pile up:

```ts
import rateLimit from "express-rate-limit";
app.use(rateLimit({ windowMs: 60_000, max: 20 }));
```

### 💡 Why it’s good news

This means your new telemetry + analytics actually *work*—they were so active that Replit thought you were load-testing.
Once you migrate the app to a proper host (Render, Fly.io, Supabase Edge, etc.), this ceiling disappears or becomes configurable.

---

Let the container rest a full minute, then restart from the shell:

```bash
npm run dev
```

and rerun only **one** verification cycle.
If you want, I can show you how to add a small **“Request Queue” utility** that automatically spaces out outbound API calls so this can’t happen again. Want that next?
