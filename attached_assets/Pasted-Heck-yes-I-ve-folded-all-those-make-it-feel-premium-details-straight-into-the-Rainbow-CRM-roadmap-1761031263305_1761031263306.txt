Heck yes. I’ve folded all those “make-it-feel-premium” details straight into the Rainbow CRM roadmap, with crisp tickets, acceptance criteria, and a short, momentum-friendly sequence. This keeps the council/coins work queued up, but we’ll nail the little things first.

# 🌈 Rainbow CRM Roadmap — Delight & Usability Track

## Phase 11.3 — “Delight & Accessibility Blitz” (2 weeks)

**Goal:** Make core flows feel obvious, fast, and trustworthy.

### Epic A — Proof Experience 2.0

**User stories**

* As a client, I can point to changes on an image instead of writing a paragraph.
* As an operator, I can send a link that expires and see if it was viewed.

**Tickets**

1. Image pins & callouts

* FE: click-to-pin markers with numbered badges; side panel lists pins.
* Data: `proof_comments` gets `{x, y, zoom, type}` optional fields.
* QA: pins persist across refresh; keyboard accessibility (tab through pins).

2. Version compare

* FE: “Compare v2 ↔ v3” slider or side-by-side with zoom; preload both images.
* Data: `proofs.version` int; keep `prev_proof_id` for lineage.
* QA: switching versions doesn’t reset zoom/pan.

3. Structured reasons + free text

* FE: radio chips (Logo, Color, Text) + textarea.
* Data: `proof_comments.reason enum('logo','color','text','other')`.
* QA: included in email notifications and analytics events.

4. Link expiry + view receipts

* BE: `approvals.share_expires_at` nullable, `approvals.views_count`, `last_viewed_at`.
* FE: “Copy link” with dropdown: 24h / 7d / custom calendar.
* QA: expired links return friendly page; council shows views over time.

**Acceptance criteria**

* Clients can pin at least 10 notes, each with reason.
* Operators can set expiry; dashboard shows “Viewed X times, last seen <time>”.

### Epic B — Zero-State + Optimistic UI

**Tickets**

1. Zero-states with mini-tours

* FE: pipeline/assets/approvals show sample cards + 30s “how this works” tour (dismissible).
* QA: tour does not reappear once dismissed (per-user local storage).

2. Optimistic mutations everywhere

* FE: clients/events/projects/assets create/update/delete are instantaneous with rollback on error.
* QA: simulate offline → optimistic UI, then error toast + auto-undo.

3. Undo for destructive actions

* FE: toast with “Undo” for 6s; store pending deletion in memory.
* BE: deletion delayed by 6s job or soft-delete flag.
* QA: undo restores item perfectly.

**Acceptance criteria**

* P95 perceived response < 150ms for CRUD (measured by React profiler timeline).
* Undo works across assets, clients, projects.

---

### Epic C — Media Performance & Safety

**Tickets**

1. Multi-size thumbnails

* BE: background worker generates 320/640/1280 for images; store in `assets.derivatives` JSON.
* FE: responsive `srcset` + blur-up placeholder.
* QA: mobile loads 320/640 variants; full-res loads only on zoom.

2. Signed URLs + CDN

* BE: switch public proofs to watermarked, downscaled CDN; private items via signed URLs (5–15 min TTL).
* QA: revoke access = link breaks immediately.

3. Watermark previews

* Worker adds subtle diagonal watermark “Proof — Rainbow CRM”; toggle per-tenant.
* QA: not applied to final deliverables.

**Acceptance criteria**

* Median image time-to-first-paint < 400ms on 4G.
* All public proofs are watermarked & downscaled.

---

### Epic D — Accessibility to WCAG 2.1 AA

**Tickets**

1. Contrast + motion reduction

* Design tokens updated; prefers-reduced-motion disables parallax/float.

2. Keyboard support

* Proof pins, modals, and tours operable without mouse; visible focus ring.

3. Alt text + auto-alt

* Add alt field to assets; seed from Reverse Vision analysis when empty.

**Acceptance criteria**

* Axe DevTools: 0 critical issues on top 6 pages.
* Keyboard-only run: full approval flow possible.

---

### Epic E — UX Metrics in Council

**Tickets**

1. KPIs

* Track and visualize: Time-to-first-value (signup → first approval), Approval turnaround, Rework rate, Share→View conversion, P95 interactive time.
* Add `council_kpis` view + charts.

2. Alerts

* Threshold toggles (e.g., approval turnaround > 72h) → email to admin.

**Acceptance criteria**

* Council shows last 30 days for all KPIs; alert fires when thresholds crossed.

---

## Phase 11.4 — “Find & Focus” (3–4 weeks)

**Goal:** Fast triage and retrieval.

### Epic F — Work Queue (Unified Inbox)

* One table combining pending approvals, overdue tasks, unpaid invoices, “awaiting assets”.
* Filters: mine / team / by client.
* Bulk actions: complete, reassign, remind.

### Epic G — Semantic Search

* Embedding index over clients/events/assets/comments.
* Query examples: “pink gala overlay approved last month”, “St. Jude color feedback”.
* FE: single search bar with smart facets; keyboard shortcut `/`.

**Acceptance criteria**

* Query returns <1s for indexed content; top 3 results relevant for seeded dataset.

---

## Phase 11.5 — “On-Site Magic” (3–4 weeks)

**Goal:** Make field ops feel effortless.

### Epic H — Mobile Capture & QR

* Camera upload (offline-safe), auto-tag “venue-reference”.
* QR generator for proofs and event packets; scanner opens correct context in the app.
* Push notifications: approvals & changes with next-action suggestions.

**Acceptance criteria**

* 95% uploads succeed within 10 minutes of capture (retry logic).
* QR flow works on iOS & Android with spotty LTE.

---

## Phase 12.0 — Monetization Scaffold (2–3 weeks, after 11.3–11.5)

* Square/Stripe sandbox + pricing table.
* Buy Coins modal + receipt emails.
* Council → Pricing tab + revenue charts.
* Guardrails: 402 on insufficient balance; graceful UI fallback.

---

# 📋 Engineering Plan of Record (POR)

**Week 1–2 (11.3):**

* Proof pins, version compare, structured reasons, link expiry/receipts.
* Zero-states + optimistic CRUD + undo.
* Start thumbnails + watermark worker.
* Accessibility pass kickoff; Council KPI wiring.

**Week 3–5 (11.4):**

* Unified Work Queue.
* Semantic search index + UI facets.
* Continue perf: signed URLs + CDN live.

**Week 6–8 (11.5):**

* Mobile capture + QR + push.
* Reliability hardening for weak networks.

**Then 12.0:** Monetization.

---

# ✅ Definition of Done (for this track)

* Any public share shows expiry + last viewed; proofs are watermarked & downscaled.
* Approvals can be completed with pins and structured reasons, keyboard-only.
* Pipeline/Assets/Approvals have teaching zero-states and optimistic UI with Undo.
* Council displays UX KPIs; at least one alert configured and tested.
* Accessibility AA verified with automated tools and a manual keyboard run.
* P95 page interactive < 2.5s on 4G for dashboard & proofs.

---

# 🔧 Implementation Notes (to keep us fast)

* **Schema deltas:**

  * `proofs`: `version int`, `prev_proof_id uuid`, `share_expires_at timestamptz`, `views_count int`, `last_viewed_at timestamptz`.
  * `proof_comments`: `x numeric`, `y numeric`, `zoom numeric`, `reason text`.
  * `assets`: `derivatives jsonb`, `alt text`.
  * `tenant_settings`: `watermark_enabled bool`, `watermark_text text`.

* **Workers/cron:**

  * Image derivatives + watermark job on asset upload and proof generation.
  * Nightly KPI rollup view refresh.

* **DX:**

  * Feature flags for pins, version compare, and signed URLs so we can ship behind toggles.
  * “Delight Checklist” in QA: each UX perk verified per page.
