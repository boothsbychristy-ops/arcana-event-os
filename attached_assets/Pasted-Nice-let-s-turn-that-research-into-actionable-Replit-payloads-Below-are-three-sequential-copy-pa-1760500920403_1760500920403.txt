Nice — let’s turn that research into actionable Replit payloads. Below are three sequential, copy-paste-ready builder prompts you can drop into Replit (one at a time). They implement a Monday-like Project & Task Manager for Rainbow CRM: Kanban core, task detail & collaboration, and multi-view + client/booking linking + permissions.

Each payload includes:
	•	DB migration SQL
	•	Server routes to add
	•	Client pages/components to add
	•	Libraries to install
	•	Acceptance criteria and deliverables
	•	Licensing note for the libraries used

Start with Payload A (core Kanban + task model + drag/drop). When Replit finishes A, drop B, then C.

⸻

📦 Payload A — Kanban Core (Task & Board model + drag & drop)

Goal: Add Boards, Groups (columns), Tasks, and a drag-and-drop Kanban board UI that updates task status/column server-side. Use dnd-kit (or hello-pangea/dnd) and a React Kanban pattern styled with Tailwind/shadcn.

Install (server/client)

Run in server or project root:

# drag & drop toolkit + calendar later, plus helper libs
npm install @dnd-kit/core @dnd-kit/sortable @dnd-kit/modifiers
npm install @dnd-kit/accessibility
# or hello-pangea alternative:
# npm install @hello-pangea/dnd

# UI animation helper
npm install framer-motion

# if you want a prebuilt Kanban (optional)
# npm install @rcdexta/react-trello   # MIT

DB migration (append to migrations)

-- boards + groups + tasks + task_statuses for configurable colored labels
create table if not exists boards (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  owner_id uuid references users(id) on delete cascade,
  name text not null,
  description text,
  is_public boolean default false,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

create table if not exists board_groups (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  board_id uuid references boards(id) on delete cascade,
  title text not null,
  sort_index int default 0
);

create table if not exists tasks (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  board_id uuid references boards(id) on delete cascade,
  group_id uuid references board_groups(id) on delete cascade,
  owner_id uuid references users(id) on delete set null,
  title text not null,
  description text,
  status text default 'todo',
  priority text,
  due_at timestamptz,
  linked_client_id uuid references clients(id),
  linked_booking_id uuid references bookings(id),
  meta jsonb default '{}'::jsonb,
  sort_index int default 0,
  created_at timestamptz default now(),
  updated_at timestamptz default now()
);

create table if not exists task_statuses (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  board_id uuid references boards(id) on delete cascade,
  label text not null,
  color text not null, -- hex or token
  sort_index int default 0
);

Server routes (new file /server/routes/boards.js)
	•	GET /api/boards — list boards for owner
	•	POST /api/boards — create board (name, description)
	•	GET /api/boards/:id — board details + groups + tasks + statuses
	•	POST /api/boards/:id/groups — create group
	•	PATCH /api/boards/:id/groups/:groupId — reorder/rename
	•	DELETE /api/boards/:id/groups/:groupId
	•	POST /api/boards/:id/statuses — create status option
	•	PATCH /api/tasks — create task
	•	PATCH /api/tasks/:id — update task fields (title, description, due_at, linked ids)
	•	POST /api/tasks/:id/move — body { to_group_id, to_index } — moves task server side: update group_id and sort_index
	•	PATCH /api/tasks/:id/sort — reorder within group (bulk)
	•	GET /api/tasks/:id — detail (used by modal)

Important: validate ownerId from JWT middleware; ensure board belongs to owner.

Client — pages & components

Files to add:
	•	/client/src/pages/BoardsPage.jsx — lists boards and “Create Board” CTA.
	•	/client/src/pages/BoardView.jsx — main Kanban board. Fetch GET /api/boards/:id.
	•	/client/src/components/KanbanBoard/*:
	•	Board.jsx — renders groups as columns.
	•	GroupColumn.jsx — renders column header, add card button, and sortable list of TaskCard.
	•	TaskCard.jsx — compact card showing title, assignee avatar, status pill, due date.
	•	TaskDragLayer / DnD context — using dnd-kit sortable utilities.
	•	/client/src/components/StatusPill.jsx — colored pill that reflects task.status.
	•	Use framer-motion for subtle drag animations.

Behavior
	•	Dragging a card to another column calls POST /api/tasks/:id/move with to_group_id and target index; on success update UI.
	•	Reordering in same column calls PATCH /api/tasks/:id/sort or bulk patch.
	•	Click a card → open Task Detail Modal (Payload B will implement full modal).

Acceptance Criteria (A)
	1.	Can create boards and groups.
	2.	Board view loads groups and tasks with correct order.
	3.	Dragging card between columns updates DB and persists after reload.
	4.	Reordering within a column updates DB and persists.
	5.	Status pill color reflects task.status mapping from task_statuses.
	6.	Board page is responsive (<768px stacks columns vertically or supports horizontal scroll).

Deliverables
	•	migrations added, boards.js routes implemented, front-end Board view with dnd-kit drag & drop, status pill component, basic create/edit task flows.

Licensing note
	•	dnd-kit, framer-motion, and the suggested Kanban libraries are MIT — safe for closed-source commercial use. If you opt for a commercial Kanban component later, you can license it without needing to open-source your code.

📦 Payload B — Task Detail, Comments, Attachments, Subtasks

Goal: Implement Task Detail modal with rich fields, comments/updates, file attachments (uploads), subtasks (subitems), checklist, and activity log.

Install

npm install react-dropzone multer
# if you prefer S3 or object storage SDKs later: aws-sdk or @google-cloud/storage

DB migration (append)

create table if not exists subtasks (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  task_id uuid references tasks(id) on delete cascade,
  title text not null,
  is_done boolean default false,
  sort_index int default 0,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

create table if not exists task_comments (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  task_id uuid references tasks(id) on delete cascade,
  author_user_id uuid references users(id) on delete set null,
  body text not null,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

create table if not exists task_attachments (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  task_id uuid references tasks(id) on delete cascade,
  uploader_id uuid references users(id) on delete set null,
  filename text,
  url text not null,
  size int,
  mime text,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

create table if not exists task_activity (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  task_id uuid references tasks(id) on delete cascade,
  actor_user_id uuid references users(id) on delete set null,
  action text not null,
  payload jsonb default '{}'::jsonb,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

Server routes (new /server/routes/tasks.js or extend)
	•	GET /api/tasks/:id — returns task + subtasks + comments + attachments + activity
	•	POST /api/tasks/:id/subtasks — create subtask
	•	PATCH /api/subtasks/:id — toggle is_done / edit title
	•	DELETE /api/subtasks/:id
	•	POST /api/tasks/:id/comments — body {body} — insert comment + create activity log
	•	GET /api/tasks/:id/comments
	•	POST /api/tasks/:id/attachments — multipart upload via multer (server stores locally or to object store based on config). Return URL.
	•	DELETE /api/tasks/:id/attachments/:attachmentId
	•	GET /api/tasks/:id/activity — list activity entries

Uploads: Implement server-side validation (max file size, allowed mime types). Return structured URL and store uploader id.

Client — Task Modal & Components

Files:
	•	/client/src/components/TaskModal/TaskModal.jsx — full detail modal
	•	Sections: Header (title, status dropdown), Left column (description, attachments, subtasks), Right column (assignees, due date, linked client/booking, meta), Bottom: Comments feed + composer.
	•	/client/src/components/Comments/CommentsList.jsx and CommentItem.jsx — show author, timestamp, body, attachments (inline link).
	•	/client/src/components/Attachments/AttachmentUploader.jsx — dropzone UI + preview + upload status.
	•	/client/src/components/Subtasks/SubtaskList.jsx — inline checklist with drag reorder support (optional).
	•	Hook into task_activity to show “X changed status to Y” entries.

Behavior
	•	Posting a comment updates UI optimistically and persists; server writes activity log.
	•	Uploading files shows progress, then attaches link in comments or attachments section.
	•	Subtasks persist and can be marked done — optionally compute percentage complete for parent task meta.

Acceptance Criteria (B)
	1.	Clicking a task card opens Task Modal with full data.
	2.	Create comment → persists and appears in CommentsList.
	3.	Upload attachment → stored and visible; deletes remove record & file.
	4.	Create subtasks and mark done → persists; percent complete shown.
	5.	Activity log shows status changes, assignments, and comment posts.
	6.	Modal is keyboard accessible and trap focus while open.

Deliverables
	•	Subtasks, comments, attachments DB/tables/routes; Task Modal UI; upload support; activity log.

📦 Payload C — Views, Filters, Client/Booking Linkages & Permissions

Goal: Add multiple views (Calendar), filters, linking tasks to clients/bookings, team & role permissions, and board shareability (private vs shareable types). Also add quick bulk-actions and saved filters.

Install

npm install @fullcalendar/react @fullcalendar/daygrid @fullcalendar/interaction date-fns

DB additions (append)

create table if not exists teams (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  owner_id uuid references users(id) on delete cascade,
  name text not null,
  member_ids uuid[] default array[]::uuid[],
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

-- board visibility: already had is_public; add type
alter table boards add column board_type text default 'main' check (board_type in ('main','private','shareable'));

Server routes (extend)
	•	GET /api/calendar/tasks?from=&to=&staff_id= — returns tasks with due_at (or scheduled meta) for FullCalendar.
	•	PATCH /api/tasks/:id/dates — update due date or start/end for timeline/calendar.
	•	GET /api/teams / POST /api/teams / PATCH /api/teams/:id — manage teams (member arrays).
	•	POST /api/boards/:id/share — add guest email/invite (creates limited guest user in users table with viewer role and link to this board).
	•	GET /api/boards/:id/permissions — returns who can view/edit (for UI).

Permissions middleware
	•	Expand auth middleware to check:
	•	Owner/Admin can view/edit any Main/Private boards they own.
	•	Staff with assigned tasks can edit tasks where they are assignee or team member.
	•	Guests (shareable boards) can view and comment but cannot change board structure.
	•	Implement canEditTask(user, task) helper.

Client — new pages & features
	•	/calendar page using FullCalendar: show tasks by due_at. Dragging an event opens confirm and calls PATCH /api/tasks/:id/dates.
	•	Board header: visibility toggle (Main/Private/Shareable) + share button to generate guest invite link.
	•	Filters in BoardView: assignee(s) dropdown, status chips, priority, date range, linked client filter (search).
	•	Saved Filters: user can save filter sets (persist in localStorage or DB later). Add quick multi-select bulk actions: change status, assign staff, move to different group.
	•	Team management UI: in Settings → Teams, create teams and choose members.
	•	Client/Booking link in TaskModal: dropdown to link/unlink existing client or booking. If linked, show a mini-card with link to associated client/booking.

Acceptance Criteria (C)
	1.	Calendar shows tasks as events and drag/reschedule persists.
	2.	Board filters return expected subset; saved filters can be used in current session.
	3.	Team CRUD works; members show in assignee dropdown.
	4.	Permission checks: Guests can view only shared boards; staff can edit only allowed tasks.
	5.	Linking a task to a client or booking shows correct mini-card and clicking navigates to that client/booking page.
	6.	Bulk actions work on selected cards (e.g., change status for 5 selected tasks).

Deliverables
	•	Calendar view with drag/reschedule, teams & permission model, board sharing (guest invites), filters & bulk actions, client/booking linking UI.

Notes on UX & Fidelity to Monday.com
	•	Kanban behavior: dnd-kit + sortable utilities can be tuned to reproduce Monday’s smooth drag (animations, lift delay, collision, active drop preview). Use framer-motion for animations.
	•	Status column & colors: store status list per board in task_statuses. Render pills with color tokens matching Empress theme. Admin can edit statuses per board.
	•	Subitems: subtasks table implements Monday-style subitems. You might later implement rollups and aggregate progress bars.
	•	Views parity: Kanban + Calendar complete the majority of Monday UX. Timeline/Gantt could be added later with a Gantt library if needed.

Licensing summary
	•	dnd-kit, @hello-pangea/dnd, framer-motion, FullCalendar, react-dropzone are MIT or permissive — safe for closed-source commercial use.
	•	If you choose to use commercial components (Syncfusion, Smart UI), those are licensed and do not force your code to be open-sourced — but require purchasing a license.

How to run (developer checklist)
	1.	Add migrations and run npm run db:migrate / Drizzle push.
	2.	Start server: npm run dev (or existing dev scripts).
	3.	Start client (npm run dev:client) and open Boards page → create a Board → add Groups → create Tasks → try dragging.
	4.	Open Task modal → create comments → upload attachments.
	5.	Open Calendar → verify tasks appear by due date → drag/reschedule.

Ready-to-paste Builder Prompt (short form)

If you want, I can now assemble Payload A into a single pasteable “Architect” prompt for Replit that instructs it to add migrations, routes, and front-end files automatically. Tell me “Paste Payload A” and I’ll format it precisely for the Replit builder box. After Payload A is confirmed, I’ll output Payload B and C in the same ready-to-paste format.

Do you want me to paste Payload A now?
