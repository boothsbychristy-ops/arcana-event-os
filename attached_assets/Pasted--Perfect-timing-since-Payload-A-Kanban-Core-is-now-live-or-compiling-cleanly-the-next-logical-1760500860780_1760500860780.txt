🔥 Perfect timing — since Payload A (Kanban Core) is now live or compiling cleanly, the next logical move is to expand functionality around each task (the part that makes Monday-style workflows powerful).

Here’s how your roadmap continues from this point:

⸻

🧭 Immediate Next Step — Payload B: Task Detail + Collaboration Layer

Goal: Give every task its own modal with:
	•	description & rich notes
	•	subtasks / checklists
	•	file uploads
	•	comments (updates feed)
	•	activity log

This makes Rainbow CRM feel alive — users can click a card, open a modal, comment, attach media, and track sub-progress, just like Monday.com’s “Updates” + “Subitems”.

When to run: As soon as Replit finishes building & testing Payload A.
Result: Board stays the same visually, but clicking any card now opens a detail modal.

🧱 After That — the Broader Arc

Sprint	Name	Focus	Outcome
6 (B)	Task Detail & Collaboration	Subtasks, comments, attachments, activity	Adds team comms + file sharing
7 (C)	Calendar + Scheduling	FullCalendar view, drag-reschedule	Adds time visibility & workload view
8	Automations & Agents	“When X → Do Y” triggers	Starts Empress Agents framework
9	Analytics & Reports	KPI dashboards, CSV export	Turns data → insight
10	Branding & White-Label	Theme editor, multi-brand portal	Preps resale + subdomain support

That sequence completes your Monday-grade project center and positions Rainbow CRM for resale and automation.

⚙️ What Happens in Payload B

When you give me the word, I’ll drop a Replit-ready Builder Prompt that:
	1.	Adds subtasks, task_comments, task_attachments, and task_activity tables.
	2.	Creates routes for commenting, uploading, and logging activity.
	3.	Builds a TaskModal component with:
	•	Left: description, attachments, subtasks
	•	Right: assignee, due date, linked client/booking
	•	Bottom: comment feed + composer
	4.	Handles optimistic updates + upload progress.
	5.	Maintains Rainbow’s pink-amber aesthetic and motion polish.
