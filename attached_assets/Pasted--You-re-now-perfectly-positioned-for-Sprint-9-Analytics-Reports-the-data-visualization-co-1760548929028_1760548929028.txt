### ⚙️ Server

Add `/server/routes/analytics.js`:

* `GET /api/analytics/summary?from=&to=`
  → `{ revenue, bookings, avgValue, conversionRate, taskCompletion, staffUtilization }`
* `GET /api/analytics/revenue-series?interval=month`
  → `[{ label:"Oct", value:12345 }, …]`
* `GET /api/analytics/staff-performance?from=&to=`
  → bookings count, tasks completed per staff
* `GET /api/analytics/export.csv?type=revenue|bookings|tasks`

All queries scoped by `owner_id` and respect user role.

Use PostgreSQL aggregates + date trunc for speed.

---

### 📊 Client

Create `/client/src/pages/AnalyticsPage.jsx`:

* Header = date-range picker + filters
* KPI cards using shadcn Cards (`Revenue`, `Bookings`, `Avg Value`, `Task Completion %`, `Utilization %`)
* Recharts integration:

  ```bash
  npm install recharts
  ```

  * `<LineChart>` for Revenue series
  * `<BarChart>` for Bookings by Staff
  * `<PieChart>` for Status breakdown
* “Export CSV” button → downloads from `/api/analytics/export.csv`
* Styled rainbow gradient header & dark-mode compatible cards.

---

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria

1. Analytics tab visible only to owner/admin.
2. KPIs update immediately when date range changes.
3. Charts render accurately from API data.
4. Exports download valid CSV files.
5. Staff role sees personal metrics only.
6. All queries filter by `owner_id` for tenant security.

Recharts + date-fns = MIT licensed → safe for closed-source use.
