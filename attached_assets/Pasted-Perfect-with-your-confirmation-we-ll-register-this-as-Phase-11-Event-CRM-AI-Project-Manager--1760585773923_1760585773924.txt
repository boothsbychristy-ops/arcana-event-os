Perfect — with your confirmation, we’ll register this as **Phase 11: Event CRM + AI Project Manager Integration** in the Empress OS roadmap.

Here’s what this payload will include:

---

### ⚙️ **Phase 11 Payload — Event CRM & AI Project Manager**

**Modules to Build**

1. **Event CRM Core**

   * Pipelines: Lead → Proposal → Booked → Fulfilled → Renewal
   * Booking form generator + date/resource conflict logic
   * Contract + e-signature + invoice templates with partial payments + tips
   * Client portal with progress summary + “Action Items” checklist

2. **Creative Collaboration Suite**

   * File approval workflow (upload → review → feedback → approval)
   * Embeddable template + backdrop libraries (Paddee / PB Backdrops widgets)
   * AI prompt sample preview flow (uses Empress V7 anchors + seed image to generate draft via Veo 3)

3. **Project Management Layer**

   * Task + subtask templates auto-generated per package type
   * Dynamic deadlines relative to event date (T-X days)
   * Internal checklists vs client-visible checklists
   * Role-based dashboards (Admin, Designer, Client, Staff)

4. **AI Automation Agents**

   * Drive Watcher Agent → detect new files and auto-build CSV of URLs
   * Social Agent → auto-generate Instagram/Facebook posts when gallery is published
   * Reminder Agent → automated email/SMS follow-ups for pending approvals or payments
   * Vision Agent → face tagging + smart gallery sorting

5. **UX/UI**

   * Neon glass interface with progressive disclosure for CRM/PM tools
   * Contextual onboarding (coach-marks + skip/recall tips)
   * Consistent cross-device design (desktop Studio + iPad Kiosk mode)
   * Emotional design hooks (celebratory micro-animations on client approval)

6. **Integrations & Storage**

   * Google Drive / Dropbox sync for deliverables
   * Zapier / Make connectors for external automations
   * Supabase tables: `crm_clients`, `bookings`, `tasks`, `approvals`, `agents_logs`

---

**Next-Step Tasks**

1. Generate database migration payload for the above tables.
2. Add API endpoints: `/api/bookings`, `/api/tasks`, `/api/approvals`, `/api/agents`.
3. Build React pages: `/crm`, `/crm/:id`, `/projects`, `/approvals`.
4. Extend Admin Dashboard metrics with bookings + approval stats.
5. Hook AI agent triggers to Supabase storage events (new file = start automation).

Do you want me to format this as a **ready-to-run JSON payload pack** for Replit (like the earlier phases) so you can load it directly into Baby Empress OS?
