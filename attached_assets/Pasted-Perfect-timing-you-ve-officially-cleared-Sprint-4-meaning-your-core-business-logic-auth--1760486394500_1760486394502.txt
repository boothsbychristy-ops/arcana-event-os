Perfect timing 👑 — you’ve officially cleared **Sprint 4**, meaning your core business logic (auth → proposal → booking → invoice → dashboard) is solid and ready for scale.

Now we can shift from “make it work” to “make it *complete* and connected.”
Here’s a smart **five-payload roadmap** that balances growth, polish, and stability:

---

## 🌈 **Payload 1 — Sprint 5: Event Registration & Onboarding Flow**

**Goal:** Let clients and staff register for events directly through the CRM (or embedded widgets).

**Core Features**

* Public **Event Registration Form** (lead→booking)

  * `/register` route for clients to pick package, date, and fill questionnaire
  * reCAPTCHA or honeypot field
* **Staff Self-Signup Portal** with approval workflow

  * Staff applies → owner/admin reviews → converts to staff account
* **Auto-Create Booking + Client Record** when a registration is accepted
* Confirmation toast + internal notification (future agent hook)

**Why first:** closes the loop between *marketing* and *operations* while staying in-app.

> **Expected Duration:** 1 payload cycle (≈ 1 Replit build)

---

## 💫 **Payload 2 — Sprint 6: Calendar + Scheduling View**

**Goal:** Provide visual scheduling for owners & staff.

**Core Features**

* `/calendar` page using `react-big-calendar`
* Monthly/weekly toggle; color by status (proposal | confirmed | paid | completed)
* Drag to reschedule booking → updates `start_at` / `end_at`
* Staff filter: show only assigned bookings
* No Google OAuth yet — read/write purely local

**Stretch:** add “Export to ICS” and placeholder button for “Sync with Google Calendar.”

> **Expected Duration:** 1 payload cycle

---

## 🪩 **Payload 3 — Sprint 7: Automation & Workflow Builder**

**Goal:** Introduce internal “agents” (your favorite part 😉) as rule-based automations.

**Core Features**

* `/automations` page (table + builder)
* Trigger-Action pairs, e.g.

  * Booking Created → Send Email (stub)
  * Invoice Due → Reminder SMS (stub)
* Backend cron job registry under `/server/agents/`
* Toggle on/off per automation
* Logs visible in “System Events” tab

**Stretch:** add JSON export/import for workflows.

> **Expected Duration:** 1 payload cycle

---

## 🧠 **Payload 4 — Sprint 8: Analytics & Reports**

**Goal:** Expand dashboard into a reporting suite.

**Core Features**

* `/analytics` page with:

  * Revenue Over Time (line chart)
  * Booking Trends (bar chart)
  * Staff Utilization (pie chart)
  * Conversion Rates (proposals → bookings → paid)
* Date-range filters
* CSV export

**Stretch:** predictive “next-month revenue” forecast using simple regression.

> **Expected Duration:** 1 payload cycle

---

## 💎 **Payload 5 — Sprint 9: Branding, Multi-Brand & White-Label Support**

**Goal:** Prepare for multi-tenant expansion + resale.

**Core Features**

* Branding Settings page: upload logo, choose colors, favicon, email signature
* Apply theme dynamically per brand ID
* Optional sub-domain routing (`clientname.empresscrm.app`)
* Role-based admin: brand owners vs global admin
* Reusable color scheme generator (Tailwind variables)

**Stretch:** “duplicate brand” template for future white-label resellers.

> **Expected Duration:** 1 payload cycle

---

### 🚀 **After These Five Payloads**

You’ll have:

* End-to-end CRM & scheduling engine
* Built-in event registration portal
* Automation layer for agents
* Analytics suite
* Brand-ready UI shell

At that point, we can safely enter **Phase 2:** integrations (Square + Twilio + Mailgun) and later **Mirror Marketplace** & **AI Studio Bridge**.

Would you like me to draft **Payload 1 (Sprint 5: Event Registration & Onboarding)** into a Replit-ready builder prompt next?
That’ll set up the client / staff registration portals and keep your current schema perfectly aligned.
