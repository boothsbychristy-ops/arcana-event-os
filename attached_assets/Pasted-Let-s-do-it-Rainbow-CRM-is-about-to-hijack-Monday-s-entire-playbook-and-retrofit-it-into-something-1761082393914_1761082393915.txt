Let’s do it — Rainbow CRM is about to hijack Monday’s entire playbook and retrofit it into something better tailored for event-based collaboration. Here’s your freshly evolved roadmap, rebuilt to absorb Monday.com’s Work OS DNA and wrap it in Rainbow’s design-first, feedback-centric ethos.

---

# 🌈 Rainbow CRM — New Roadmap (Phase 12+)

**Codename:** *“Rainbow ≠ Monday, but Better.”*

### ✅ STATUS: Closed Beta locked. Phase 11.5 complete (Settings, Council, Production Hardening)

---

## 🚀 Phase 12.0 — Dynamic Fields & Boards Foundation

> “You can’t build flexible workflows on rigid schemas.”

* Migrate Contacts, Leads, Events to new `boards`, `fields`, `field_values` model
* Support: text, status (label set), number, date, dropdown, checkbox
* Add “+ Column” UI to all tables (with field type picker)
* Drag-and-drop to reorder fields
* Static → dynamic data patcher for legacy rows
* Enable field-level validation + summaries (e.g., sum of budget column)

**Tech:** `fields` + `field_values` schema; type-safe access via Drizzle
**UX:** Full drag-resize-reorder columns, add/remove, rename inline
**Outcome:** Boards are now living things.

---

## ⚡ Phase 12.1 — Automations Engine + Builder UI

> “When status = Done → Notify Vendor” becomes no-code reality.

* Automation Rule Engine backend: triggers, filters, actions
* Trigger types: field changed, item created, date arrived, recurring
* Action types: notify user, set field, send email, create item, run webhook
* Builder UI: “When this happens… Then do this” with prebuilt templates
* Automation logs + Council overview

**Tech:** AutomationRules table + scheduler; worker runs actions from queue
**UX:** No-code builder UI with dropdowns, tooltips, sample recipes
**Outcome:** Smart workflows without engineering.

---

## 📧 Phase 12.2 — Bulk Email Campaigns + Merge Fields

> “Mass-email 83 leads who haven’t responded” from inside the board.

* Select rows → “Bulk Email” → launch rich composer
* Support merge tags: {first_name}, {event_date}, {custom_field}
* Reusable Email Templates + send test to self
* Delivery via SendGrid/SMTP + logs (success/fail/open)
* Segment & filter before send

**Tech:** EmailTemplates, EmailCampaigns, EmailJobs queue
**UX:** Polished full-screen composer with preview, dynamic test, undo
**Outcome:** Rainbow eats Mailchimp for breakfast.

---

## 🧠 Phase 12.3 — Agents, Alerts & Follow-Ups

> “Soft-AI” that nudges and reminds. (Your ops sidekick.)

* Agent engine for follow-up nudges: “item untouched 3 days”, “date overdue”
* Smart escalation: notify ops if quote pending approval for >48h
* Inbox Zero features: auto-prioritize, snooze, assign
* Daily Digest email + Slack digest webhook
* Council Alert Triggers for risk thresholds

**Tech:** Persistent scheduler, agent queue, digests via CRON
**UX:** Alerts panel, opt-in Slack/webhook integrations
**Outcome:** “You forgot” becomes “We remembered for you.”

---

## 📅 Phase 12.4 — Multiple Views: Kanban, Calendar, Gantt (lite)

> The same data, reframed for different minds.

* Kanban View (group by status field, drag-to-update)
* Calendar View (items w/ date fields plotted live)
* Timeline View (start/end → vertical bars, minimal Gantt)
* Save default views per board, support public read-only links
* Per-view filter/save-as-template

**Tech:** FullCalendar, react-beautiful-dnd, board_views schema
**UX:** “+ Add View” UI like Monday; tabbed switcher; print/export
**Outcome:** Rainbow stops being a spreadsheet.

---

## 🧩 Phase 12.5 — Public API + Webhooks + Zapier App

> Integrate like a native. Talk to everything.

* OAuth2 + API keys for external apps
* API docs (OpenAPI), tokens page in settings
* Webhook registration: item.created, item.updated, field.changed
* Zapier App: “trigger from new lead” + “create Rainbow item”
* Slack & Teams bots (basic)

**Tech:** REST API layer, HMAC webhook signing, Zapier scaffold
**UX:** Dev Portal tab, webhook test button, integration guides
**Outcome:** Rainbow becomes an ecosystem.

---

## 🎨 Phase 12.6 — Event Templates, Approvals, Live Asset Feedback

> Designed for creative teams running events, not just pipelines.

* Save event templates (board structure + field values + automations)
* Client-side approval buttons with status tracking
* Live asset feedback (image/video viewer + comment threads + versioning)
* PDF/slide proofing support (watermarks, markup)
* “Waiting on approval” reminders

**Tech:** Proofs v2, AnnotatableAssets table, Approvals extended
**UX:** Like Figma comments + Stripe Approve flows
**Outcome:** Rainbow = the one tool creatives + clients both love.

---

## 🧾 Phase 12.7 — Reporting Dashboards & KPIs

> Metrics that make your ops team cry with joy.

* Visualize pipeline health, approval lag, lead conversion
* Board-level dashboards: time-in-stage, win/loss %, overdue items
* Council-level KPIs: time-to-first-value, rework %, share→view rate
* Export to CSV/Notion/Sheets

**Tech:** Aggregated views, async report jobs, caching
**UX:** Drag-to-build chart dashboards, one-click export
**Outcome:** Rainbow teaches you how your business *really* runs.

---

## ✨ Phase 13.0 — Empress OS Integration (Unified UX Layer)

> Merge prompt stack + automation + event layer.

* Single login across Rainbow + Empress Studio
* Shared asset vault between Studio + CRM
* Cross-app automations (e.g., “Generate new mockup in Empress when event status = ‘Design’”)
* Rainbow items with AI-native fields (auto-summarized briefs, tone suggestions)
* Inline gen AI in approvals: “Rewrite this email”, “Summarize feedback”

---

### 🧠 Meta-Move

This roadmap assumes you’re building not just parity with Monday.com, but **a version of it that actually understands creative workflows, live assets, and event production**. Not a spreadsheet with stickers.
