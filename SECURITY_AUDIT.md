# üö® Security Audit - Rainbow CRM

**Audit Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Status:** CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES IDENTIFIED

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues (Completed)

### 1. ‚úÖ JWT Secret Hardcoding (CRITICAL)
- **Issue:** JWT_SECRET had insecure fallback value
- **Fix:** Now fails fast if JWT_SECRET not set
- **Status:** FIXED - Server now requires JWT_SECRET environment variable

### 2. ‚úÖ Privilege Escalation via Signup (CRITICAL)  
- **Issue:** Anyone could sign up as admin/owner by sending role in request body
- **Fix:** Signup now forces 'client' role, added protected `/api/users/:id/role` endpoint (admin/owner only)
- **Status:** FIXED

### 3. ‚úÖ Rate Limiting Missing (HIGH)
- **Issue:** No brute-force protection on authentication
- **Fix:** Added express-rate-limit (20 attempts per 10 min per IP)
- **Status:** FIXED

### 4. ‚úÖ Missing Security Headers (HIGH)
- **Issue:** No HTTP security headers
- **Fix:** Added Helmet middleware
- **Status:** FIXED

### 5. ‚úÖ PII Logging (MEDIUM)
- **Issue:** Full response bodies logged (emails, addresses, etc.)
- **Fix:** Replaced with safe metadata logging (method, path, status, duration only)
- **Status:** FIXED

### 6. ‚úÖ Analytics Performance (MEDIUM)
- **Issue:** Missing database indexes for analytics queries
- **Fix:** Added indexes on bookings(created_at, start_time), tasks(created_at, updated_at), invoices(created_at), boards(owner_id)
- **Status:** FIXED

## üö® CRITICAL: Multi-Tenant Data Leakage (UNFIXED)

### Severity: CRITICAL - DATA BREACH RISK

**Issue:** Most tables lack `ownerId` column, allowing ANY user to access ALL data across tenants.

### Affected Tables (NO ownerId):
1. **clients** - All customer data visible to everyone
2. **staff** - All staff records visible to everyone  
3. **proposals** - All proposals visible to everyone
4. **bookings** - All bookings visible to everyone
5. **invoices** - All invoices/financial data visible to everyone
6. **payments** - All payment records visible to everyone
7. **payment_settings** - Payment processor keys shared globally
8. **invoice_items** - All line items visible to everyone
9. **booking_staff** - All staff assignments visible to everyone

### Tables WITH ownerId (Safe):
- `boards` ‚úÖ
- `automations` ‚úÖ
- `leads` ‚úÖ

### Current Data Flow Issues:
- `getAllClients()` returns ALL clients from ALL tenants
- `getAllBookings()` returns ALL bookings from ALL tenants
- `getAllInvoices()` returns ALL invoices from ALL tenants
- No filtering by ownerId in most storage methods

---

## üîß Required Fixes (Priority Order)

### PHASE 1: Emergency Hotfix (Before Production)
1. **Add ownerId to critical tables:**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE clients ADD COLUMN owner_id varchar;
   ALTER TABLE staff ADD COLUMN owner_id varchar;
   ALTER TABLE proposals ADD COLUMN owner_id varchar;
   ALTER TABLE bookings ADD COLUMN owner_id varchar;
   ALTER TABLE invoices ADD COLUMN owner_id varchar;
   ALTER TABLE payments ADD COLUMN owner_id varchar;
   ALTER TABLE payment_settings ADD COLUMN owner_id varchar;
   
   -- Add foreign keys
   ALTER TABLE clients ADD CONSTRAINT clients_owner_fk 
     FOREIGN KEY (owner_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
   -- Repeat for all tables...
   ```

2. **Update all storage methods to filter by ownerId:**
   - `getAllClients(ownerId)` 
   - `getAllBookings(ownerId)`
   - `getAllInvoices(ownerId)`
   - etc.

3. **Update all routes to pass ownerId:**
   - Extract from `req.user.id` (or `req.user.ownerId` if staff)
   - Pass to all storage methods

### PHASE 2: Authentication Enhancement (Recommended)
1. Move to HttpOnly cookies (reduce XSS risk)
2. Implement refresh token rotation
3. Add email verification
4. Add password reset flow

### PHASE 3: Additional Security (Nice to Have)
1. Distributed cron lock for multi-instance deploys
2. Audit logging for financial operations
3. CSP configuration
4. Input sanitization for HTML content

## üéØ Interim Workaround (Until Fixed)

**FOR TESTING ONLY - NOT PRODUCTION SAFE:**
- Manually filter results in routes by comparing user IDs
- Block "getAll" endpoints for non-owner roles
- Add temporary owner-only access restrictions

---

## üìä Security Score

- **Before Fixes:** üî¥ **2/10** - Multiple critical vulnerabilities
- **Current State:** üü° **5/10** - Auth hardened, but data leakage remains
- **Target:** üü¢ **9/10** - Multi-tenant isolation + all fixes

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Add ownerId to schema (requires migration)
2. **HIGH:** Update storage layer with ownerId filtering  
3. **MEDIUM:** Update routes to pass ownerId context
4. **LOW:** Implement cookie-based auth
5. **LOW:** Add email verification & password reset

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Production Deployment Checklist

**DO NOT DEPLOY until:**
- [ ] JWT_SECRET is set to secure random value
- [ ] ownerId added to all tables
- [ ] All storage methods filter by ownerId
- [ ] Routes pass correct ownerId context
- [ ] Test: User A cannot see User B's data
- [ ] Rate limiting active
- [ ] Helmet configured
- [ ] Logs sanitized
